## About

Many large frameworks have their own state management solutions. One thing these libraries have in common is a higher level of complexity and a wide range of API interactions. Since Alpine.js is designed to be a simpler and lighter alternative to larger frameworks such as Vue and React, shouldn't the state management solution be as simple, if not simpler, too?

## Installation

### CDN

Include the following `<script>` tag in the `<head>` of your document:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ryangjchandler/spruce@0.x.x/dist/spruce.umd.js"></script>
```

> **Important**: This must be added **before** loading Alpine.js when using CDN links.

### Manual

If you wish to include Spruce with your own bundle:

```bash
yarn add @ryangjchandler/spruce
```

or:

```bash
npm install @ryangjchandler/spruce --save
```

Then add the following to your script:

```javascript
import Spruce from '@ryangjchandler/spruce'
```

## Quick start

To verify you have correctly installed Spruce, copy & paste the following code snippet into your project.

```html
<div x-data="{}" x-subscribe>
    <div x-show="$store.modal.open === 'login'">
    <p>
      This "login" modal isn't built with a11y in mind, don't actually use it
    </p>
    </div>
</div>

<div x-data="{}" x-subscribe>
    <div x-show="$store.modal.open === 'register'">
    <p>
      This "register" modal isn't built with a11y in mind, don't actually use it
    </p>
    </div>
</div>

<div x-data="{}" x-subscribe>
  <select x-model="$store.modal.open">
    <option value="login" selected>login</option>
    <option value="register">register</option>
  </select>
</div>

<script>
  Spruce.store('modal', {
    open: 'login',
  });
</script>
```

## Usage

Spruce exposes less than a handful of possible interaction points. There is an extremely simple "subscriptions" interaction which connects the roots from your Alpine component to the global store, then there is the "stores" interaction which allows you to define scopes of global state for use throughout your components.

### Entry point

If you are using the CDN build, you can interact with Spruce using the `window.Spruce` variable:

```html
<script>
    Spruce.store('modals', {
        open: 'login',
    })
</script>
```

If you are importing Spruce into your own bundle, you can interact with it like any other variable:

**store.js**

```javascript
import Spruce from '@ryangjchandler/spruce'

Spruce.store('modals', {
    open: 'login'
})

export default Spruce
```

**app.js**

```javascript
import './store'
import 'alpinejs'
```

> **Note**: You must `import` your store before Alpine.

### Subscribing your components

To access the global state from your Alpine components, you can simply add the `x-subscribe` directive to your root component.

```html
<div x-data="{}" x-subscribe>
    <span x-text="$store.application.name"></span>
</div>
```

This directive adds a new `$store` magic variable to your component. This can be used to "get" and "set" data in your global store.

### Defining global state

To define a piece of global state, you can use the `Spruce.store()` method:

```javascript
Spruce.store('application', {
    name: 'Amazing Alpine Application'
})
```

The first argument defines the top level property of the scope. The second argument defines the state for the scope, it could be a string, integer or object with nested properties.

To access the `name` property, you can do the following inside of your component:

```html
<div x-data="{}" x-subscribe>
    <span x-text="$store.application.name"></span>
</div>
```

The `<span>` will now have "Amazing Alpine Application" set as its `innerText`.

### Modifying state from outside of Alpine

You can modify your global state from external scripts using the `Spruce.store()` method too:

```javascript
Spruce.store('application', {
    name: 'Amazing Alpine Application'
})

Spruce.store('application').name = 'Amazing Spruce Integration'
```

This will trigger Alpine to re-evaluate your subscribed components and re-render.

### Resetting global state

A `Spruce.reset()` method is provided so that you can completely overwrite a global store:

```javascript
Spruce.store('application', {
    name: 'Amazing Alpine Application'
})

Spruce.reset('application', {
    name: 'Reset Application'
})
```

Calling the `reset` method will make the new state reactive and cause subscribed components to re-render.

### Externally watching for changes

You can register watchers in a similar fashion to Alpine. All you need is the full dot-notation representation of your piece of state and a callback.

```html
<script>
    Spruce.store('form', {
        name: 'Ryan',
        email: 'support@ryangjchandler.co.uk'
    })

    Spruce.watch('form.email', (old, next) => {
        // do something with the values here
    })
<script>
```

In the above snippet, when we change the value of `form.email` either from a component or externally in a separate JavaScript file, our callback will be invoked and will receive the old value, as well as the new value. This can be useful for running automatic inline validation when a property changes, or triggering an action elsewhere in another component without the need for dispatching events.

> **Note**: you can get stuck in an watch loop if you're updating other store properties that also have watchers defined.

### Event bus

Spruce ships with a basic event bus. It exposes two methods:

* `Spruce.on(eventName, callback)` - this can be used to register an event listener. This will react to any internal events, such as `init`. Your callback will receive a single `detail` property which can any information from the event, as well as the global store.

```js
Spruce.on('init', ({ store }) => {
    // do something with the store here...
})
```

* `Spruce.once(eventName, callback)` - this can be used to register an event listener that is only run **a single time**. This is useful for one time events, such as fetching HTML from the server when hovering over a button or similar.

```js
Spruce.once('event', () => {
    // do something once...
})
```

* `Spruce.off(eventName, callback)` - this can be used to unhook or de-register an event listener.

```js
var callback = () => {}

Spruce.off('init', callback)
```

> **Note**: When calling `Spruce.off()` directly, you **must** pass a named callback.

You can also unhook a listener using the function returned by `Spruce.on()`. This is especially useful for anonymous function callbacks.

```js
var off = Spruce.on('event', () => {})

off()
```

* `Spruce.emit(eventName, data = {})` - this can be used to emit an event. The first argument should be the name of the event, the second should be an object containing data. This will be merged in with the core data, which consists of a `store` property. When emitting an event, a browser event will also be dispatched with a `spruce:` prefix.

```js
Spruce.emit('event-name', { foo: 'bar' })
```

In the example above, a `spruce:event-name` event will be fired on the `window` level, so you could register an event listener inside of your Alpine component:

```html
<div x-data @spruce:event-name.window="foo = $event.detail.store.foo">
</div>
```

### Removing the need for `x-subscribe`

Alpine offers a Config API. Using this API, you can enable an experimental global `$store` variable that is declared on the `window` object. This means your components do not need to manually "subscribe" to state changes:

```html
<script>
    Spruce.config({
        globalStoreVariable: true
    })
</script>

<div x-data>
    <span x-text="$store.foo.bar"></span>
</div>
```

> **Important**: This feature is **highly unoptimized** at the moment and will actually cause all of your Alpine components on the page to re-render. This is due to the limited API that Alpine exposes to third party libraries and the `$store` variable has no simple way of knowing which element is currently retrieving data from the global store.
